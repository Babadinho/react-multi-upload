# Upload multiple images using React.js

Just a workaround to upload multiple images from your client to server using React.js. In this App i am uploading to cloudinary via my server so i converted the images to base64 before sending to client. I commented the option to use blob, in case you want to send as blob.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
